## <a name="cert-files"></a>Splinter Certificate Definitions

The `splinter cert generate` command creates the following certificates and
keys:
  - `client.crt`
  - `client.key`
  - `server.crt`
  - `server.key`
  - `generated_ca.pem`
  - `generated_ca.key`

**`client.crt`**, **`client.key`**

  Used by the Splinter node when initiating a connection to a peer.
  They are normally signed by the local certificate authority(CA)
  `generated_ca.pem`. This certificate is validated by remote peers using
  their `ca.pem` file, described below.

**`server.crt`**, **`server.key`**

  Used when accepting incoming connections from peers. The generated files are
  adequate for development purposes but in a production scenario, these should
  be signed by a CA trusted by peers, such as Let's Encrypt or Digicert. This
  should be the full chain certificate.

**`generated_ca.pem`**, **`generated_ca.key`**

  This local CA key pair is generated by the `splinter cert generate` command
  and is used to sign client and server certificates generated with the
  `splinter cert generate` command. In a production setup, only the client
  would be signed with this CA, as the server cert should be signed by a CA
  trusted by peers such as Let's Encrypt or Digicert.

  The contents of `generated_ca.pem` will end up in each remote peer's
  `ca.pem` file so that they trust your client certificate for peering.

**`ca.pem`**

  This file is _not_ created by `splinter cert generate`, but is required
  when operating without `--tls-insecure`. It should contain the CA
  certificates that were used to sign client certificates for remote peers.
  This is usually each peer's `generated_ca.pem` file. This has the effect of
  determining which nodes you can peer with. It does not need to contain the CA
  certificate which signed the local certificates (client or server), but it
  can not be empty. It is ignored when `--tls-insecure` is used.

Each of these files can be specified either in the
[splinter.toml config file][exampletoml] or as
[command line arguments][manpage] to splinterd.

## Prerequisites

This document assumes you have an Ubuntu Focal environment with the stable
versions of the `splinter` CLI and the Splinter daemon (`splinterd`) installed,
as well as sudo permissions.

Installation instructions can be found [here][apt].

## <a name="splinter-le"></a>Using Let's Encrypt Certificates with Splinter

In general, Let's Encrypt certificates are used to encrypt HTTP traffic, but
they can also be used as server certificates for Splinter.

There are many methods for obtaining TLS certificates from
[Let's Encrypt][leclients] but this guide will focus on using certs obtained
with [certbot][certbot]. If a different client is used, the resulting files
may be in different directories or named differently.

1. Follow the instructions [here][certbot] to install certbot and get certificates.

   By default, the Let's Encrypt certificates are located in
   [various directories][wherecert] in `/etc/letsencrypt`. Symlinks to the most
   current certificates are created in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/$domain`. Because
   these symlinks are updated during the [automated renewal process][renew],
   which is enabled by default for Ubuntu Focal, it is not advisable to move or
   copy the certificates from `/etc/letsencrypt`.

1. Verify the cerificates were installed.

   ``` console
   $ sudo ls -l /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.splinter.dev
   total 4
   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 692 May 26 14:34 README
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  42 May 27 16:47 cert.pem -> ../../archive/foo.splinter.dev/cert1.pem
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  43 May 27 16:47 chain.pem -> ../../archive/foo.splinter.dev/chain1.pem
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  47 May 27 16:47 fullchain.pem -> ../../archive/foo.splinter.dev/fullchain1.pem
   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  45 May 27 16:47 privkey.pem -> ../../archive/foo.splinter.dev/privkey1.pem
   ```

1. Grant `splinterd` read rights to the certificates.

   ``` console
   $ sudo chmod 0750 /etc/letsencrypt/{live,archive}
   $ sudo chgrp splinterd /etc/letsencrypt/{live,archive}
   $ sudo chgrp splinterd /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.splinter.dev/privkey.pem
   $ sudo chmod 0640 /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.splinter.dev/privkey.pem
   $ sudo chgrp splinterd /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.splinter.dev/fullchain.pem
   $ sudo chmod 0640 /etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.splinter.dev/fullchain.pem
   ```

1. Use the Splinter CLI to generate certificates. While this command generates
   both client and server certificates, we will be ignoring the server certs and
   using the Let's Encrypt certrificates instead.

   ``` console
   $ sudo splinter cert generate
   Writing file: /etc/splinter/certs/generated_ca.pem
   Writing file: /etc/splinter/certs/private/generated_ca.key
   Writing file: /etc/splinter/certs/client.crt
   Writing file: /etc/splinter/certs/private/client.key
   Writing file: /etc/splinter/certs/server.crt
   Writing file: /etc/splinter/certs/private/server.key
   ```

1. Create a `ca.pem` file. Splinterd will not start without at least one
   valid certificate in the `ca.pem` file. Since we don't have any peers yet, an
   example certificate is provided below as a workaround for this guide only. In
   a real-world scenario, this file should be populated with the contents of the
   `generated_ca.pem` from each of your peers.

   ```console
   $ sudo vi /etc/splinter/certs/ca.pem
   ```

   Paste the example certificate

   ```console
   # Example only, do not use in production.
   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

   -----END CERTIFICATE-----
   ```

   Save the file and exit

   Grant the `splinterd` group read rights

   ```console
   $ sudo chown root:splinterd /etc/splinter/certs/ca.pem
   ```

1. Create a `splinterd` config file. This step is only necessary if you haven't
   previously configured `splinterd`.

   ``` console
   $ sudo cp -p /etc/splinter/splinterd.toml.example /etc/splinter/splinterd.toml
   ```

1. Update the config file with correct certificate paths

   ```console
   $ sudo vi /etc/splinter/splinterd.toml
   ```

   ``` toml
   ...
   # List of certificate authority certificates (*.pem files).
   tls_ca_file = "/etc/splinter/certs/ca.pem"

   # A certificate signed by a certificate authority. Used by the daemon when it
   # is acting as a client (sending messages)
   tls_client_cert = "/etc/splinter/certs/client.crt"

   # Private key used by daemon when it is acting as a client
   tls_client_key = "/etc/splinter/certs/private/client.key"

   # A certificate signed by a certificate authority. Used by the daemon when it
   # is acting as a server (receiving messages).
   tls_server_cert = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.splinter.dev/fullchain.pem"

   # Private key used by daemon when it is acting as a server.
   tls_server_key = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/foo.splinter.dev/privkey.pem"
   ...
   ```

That's it! The next time you start Splinter, your traffic will be encrypted
with production-ready Let's Encrypt certificates that will automatically
renew every 90 days.
