The [splinter-ui repository](https://github.com/splintercommunity/splinter-ui) includes
the Admin UI for Splinter administration. One feature of the Splinter Admin UI 
is a profile page for the authenticated user. This document shows the new 
designs for the profile page.

## Profile

The **Profile** page shows the users profile photo, name and email supplied by 
the OAuth provider used for authentication. Additionally, a table of keys 
associated with the authenticated user is displayed.

### New Key

The **New Key** button redirects to the form for submitting a new signing key.
The new key can be entered manually or generated using the generate button.
